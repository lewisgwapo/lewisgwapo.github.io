        <hr>
        <p> When I was a kid, my skills were a mix of fun and developing.<sup>1</sup> Mahilig akong mag-drawing, even if I only had crayons, and I would spend hours creating colorful pictures.<sup>2</sup> Medyo creative ako sa paggawa ng stories sa ulo ko, imagining fantastical worlds and characters.<sup>3</sup> Mabilis akong matuto ng mga bagong kanta, memorizing the lyrics and melodies quickly.<sup>4</sup> Gusto ko maglaro sa labas, kaya active ako, running around and exploring the neighborhood.<sup>5</sup> Kahit papano, marunong akong mag-share ng toys ko, learning the importance of sharing with friends.<sup>6</sup> Medyo makulit ako, pero friendly naman, always eager to play and have fun.<sup>7</sup> Gusto ko mag-explore ng mga bagong lugar, discovering hidden corners and secret spots.<sup>8</sup> Madali akong makipagkaibigan, making new friends wherever I went.<sup>9</sup> Kahit minsan clumsy, sinusubukan ko pa rin sumayaw, enjoying the rhythm and movement.<sup>10</sup> Gusto ko tumulong sa mga simpleng gawain sa bahay, feeling helpful and responsible.<sup>11</sup> Mabilis akong mag-memorize ng mga poems sa school, reciting them with enthusiasm.<sup>12</sup> Kahit shy, sumasali ako sa mga school plays, overcoming my nervousness to perform.<sup>13</sup> Gusto ko magbasa ng mga children's books, getting lost in the stories and adventures.<sup>14</sup> Mahilig ako magtanong ng "bakit?" constantly seeking to understand the world around me.<sup>15</sup> Gusto ko mag-imagine ng mga adventures, dreaming of faraway lands and exciting escapades.<sup>16</sup> Kahit minsan iyakin, madali naman ako ma-cheer up, a hug or a kind word would do the trick.<sup>17</sup> Marunong ako maglaro ng piko, hopping and skipping my way through the game.<sup>18</sup> Gusto ko mag-build ng mga castles gamit ang blocks, creating my own little kingdoms.<sup>19</sup> Kahit hindi perpekto, sinusubukan ko mag-solve ng puzzles, enjoying the challenge of figuring things out.<sup>20</sup> Mahilig din akong kumanta, kahit sa banyo lang, belting out my favorite tunes.<sup>21</sup> Gusto ko mag-kwento sa family ko ng mga nangyari sa akin sa school, sharing my experiences and stories with them.<sup>22</sup>

        <h3>Interests</h3> 
        <hr>
        <p>Cooking is my love language.<sup>1</sup> It's how I express myself, how I connect with my heritage, and how I show care for the people I love.<sup>2</sup> From the comforting aroma of garlic sizzling in oil to the vibrant colors of freshly chopped vegetables, the kitchen is where I feel most at home.<sup>3</sup> I love experimenting with flavors, trying new recipes, and putting my own spin on classic Filipino dishes like adobo and sinigang.<sup>4</sup> There's something incredibly satisfying about transforming simple ingredients into a delicious meal that brings joy to others.<sup>5</sup> It's not just about following a recipe, it's about intuition, creativity, and a touch of magic.<sup>6</sup> And then there's photography.<sup>7</sup> My camera is an extension of my eye, a tool that allows me to capture the beauty I see in the world.<sup>8</sup> It's not just about taking pictures; it's about telling stories.<sup>9</sup> Whether it's the bustling energy of a local market, the quiet serenity of a park, or the fleeting expressions on people's faces, I try to capture the essence of the moment.<sup>10</sup> I love the way light plays on different textures, the way colors blend and contrast, the way a single image can evoke a thousand emotions.<sup>11</sup> Cooking and photography are two sides of the same coin.<sup>12</sup> They both require creativity, attention to detail, and a passion for capturing the beauty in the everyday.<sup>13</sup> They both allow me to express myself and connect with the world around me.<sup>14</sup> Sometimes, I combine my two passions, photographing the dishes I create.<sup>15</sup> It's a way to document my culinary journey and share my creations with others.<sup>16</sup> I envision creating a cookbook one day, a collection of my favorite recipes paired with my photographs, a testament to my love for both art forms.<sup>17</sup> It would be more than just a cookbook, it would be a story told through food and images, a reflection of my soul.<sup>18</sup> Until then, I'll continue to cook, to photograph, and to explore the endless possibilities of these two passions.<sup>19</sup> They bring me joy, they challenge me, and they allow me to share a piece of myself with the world.<sup>20</sup> And that, to me, is the greatest gift of all.<sup>21</sup></p>
