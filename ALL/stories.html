                    <p>Hello, I’m Sean Simoun Lewis N. Doctor<sup>1</sup> My childhood wasn’t very exciting, and I 
                        don’t remember much of it because it wasn’t really fun.<sup>2</sup> However, I still enjoyed my early 
                        years despite the challenges.<sup>3</sup> My mother and father met in Baguio, and they decided to 
                        live together quickly because they loved each other.<sup>4</sup> I have five siblings, and my youngest 
                        sibling is 10 years older than me.<sup>5</sup> There were many things I wanted to try, but because 
                        we didn’t have enough money, I couldn’t do them.<sup>5</sup> I always wanted to play in a mall park 
                        with slides and small balls.<sup>6</sup> When I was five years old, both of my grandparents on my 
                        father’s side passed away<sup>7</sup> Even though I don’t remember them well, I still wish I could 
                        have shown them my childhood life<sup>8</sup> I wanted them to see my grades, my friends, and 
                        my experiences.<sup>9</sup> I never felt my grandparents’ love because they lived far from our 
                        hometown.<sup>10</sup> I also wanted to learn how to ride a bike, but I never got the chance.<sup>11</sup> My father was always busy working to provide for our family.<sup>12</sup> Because of this, he had no time to teach me how to ride a bike or do fun activities.<sup>13</sup> I did not go to a public school because my mother was worried about my future.<sup>14</sup> At that time, public schools were not considered the best option.<sup>15</sup> When I was in Grade 5, I dreamed of becoming a chef.<sup>16</sup> We had a school project where we had to cook a meal for our teachers.<sup>18</sup> I got a perfect score, and that made me happy.<sup>19</sup> That moment made me realize that I loved cooking and wanted to be a chef.<sup>20</sup>

                    <p> When I turned 13 and entered Grade 7, my interests started to change.<sup>1</sup> I realized 
                        that studying was harder than I expected<sup>2</sup> I often struggled to focus and understand my 
                        lessons, and I didn’t know why.<sup>3</sup> Even now, I still find studying difficult<sup>4</sup> In Grade 8, I had one of the best times in school because I enjoyed table tennis very much.<sup>5</sup> It was my main sport, and I even made it to the finals in our DAOP tournament—and I won.<sup>6</sup> However, in Grade 9, I experienced something terrifying that left me traumatized.<sup>7</sup> One of my 
                        classmates was possessed, and it scared me a lot.<sup>8</sup> She and her friends went to the 
                        restroom, and they saw the door lock moving on its own.<sup>9</sup> There was no airflow in the 
                        hallway, yet the school staff said it was just the wind.<sup>10</sup> However, I saw it clearly with my 
                        own two eyes—or rather, four eyes since I was already wearing glasses.<sup>11</sup> That experience 
                        made me believe in ghosts for the first time.<sup>12</sup> On March 5, 2020, the pandemic started, 
                        and that was the beginning of my boring teenage life<sup>13</sup> We had online classes, and it was 
                        the most boring time of my life. Every day, I had to wake up, face my device, hurt my eyes, and hurt my back from sitting too long.<sup>14</sup> My table tennis career ended because I didn’t know how to continue after the pandemic.<sup>15</sup> By the time the pandemic was almost over, I was in Grade 12, second semester.<sup>16</sup> Finally, we had face-to-face classes at my school, University of the East – Manila.<sup>17</sup> I enjoyed it, but not that much because I didn’t have many friends back then.<sup>18</sup> I also didn’t know where I belonged.<sup>19</sup> Some of my Junior High School classmates were also my schoolmates, but I was a late enrollee because I took time choosing where to study. <sup>20</sup>That’s why I didn’t have close friends to rely on, especially when it came to academics.<sup>21</sup>

                        College years are the best because you will meet a lot of friends, a lot of enemies, and competitive people.<sup>1</sup> But at the end of the day, you will still learn things the hard way.<sup>2</sup> College has taught me many lessons, and one of them is that learning is never easy.<sup>3</sup> The program I chose is very challenging, and I am still struggling with how to study properly.<sup>4</sup> I have tried many different ways to improve my study habits, both hard and easy methods.<sup>5</sup> I even stayed awake for 24 hours just to see if I could remember my lectures better.<sup>6</sup> College has also taught me how to do things I never did before, like drinking alcohol.<sup>7</sup> University life is like living in a barangay—there are so many Marites spreading gossip.<sup>8</sup> When a rumor starts, it spreads to all students in just an hour.<sup>9</sup> College is fun, but it can also be hard, especially when you have a childhood friend.<sup>10</sup> Our busy schedules make it difficult to see each other.<sup>11</sup> This is tough for me because my childhood friends were always by my side growing up.<sup>12</sup> Now, when I need them, I can’t see them because they are busy or spending time with new friends.<sup>13</sup> I always think about when or how I will graduate because, right now, I am still unsure.<sup>14</sup> After college, I plan to pursue my dreams in the UAE with my sister.<sup>15</sup> My goal is to gain job experience here first before leaving the country.<sup>16</sup> I visited the UAE last year, and I saw that life there is good.<sup>17</sup> I am ready to leave my loved ones behind to make my life easier.<sup>18</sup> Even though it will be hard to say goodbye, I believe it is the best decision for my future.<sup>19</sup> No matter where life takes me, I will always cherish the experiences and friendships I made in college.<sup>20</sup>
