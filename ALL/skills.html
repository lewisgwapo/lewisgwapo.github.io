                    I'm 19, and I still don't know what skills I have.<sup>1</sup> I like to cook, and it was my dream to be a chef, but due to financial reasons, I can't pursue it.<sup>2</sup> I'm currently a photographer for UE Dawn, but sadly, my camera broke last year, so I'm not active right now.<sup>3</sup> I really like taking pictures, especially landscapes.<sup>4</sup> I've always wanted to travel and capture the beauty of nature with my camera.<sup>5</sup> I love taking photos of animals, mountains, and anything pleasing to the eye.<sup>6</sup> There's something about nature that makes me feel at peace.<sup>7</sup> Whenever I see a breathtaking view, I wish I had my camera with me.<sup>8</sup> I'm also good at basketball, but only when no one is watching.<sup>9</sup> For some reason, I get nervous when people are around.<sup>10</sup> I can whistle with my mouth closed, which is a weird but fun skill.<sup>11</sup> I enjoy solving puzzles, and I have a lot of puzzle games on my phone.<sup>12</sup> The more challenging the puzzle, the more I enjoy it.<sup>13</sup> I find satisfaction in figuring out tricky problems.<sup>14</sup> Sometimes, I lose track of time just playing puzzle games.<sup>15</sup> I also like watching cooking videos, even though I can't cook professionally.<sup>16</sup> I try to recreate some recipes, but they don’t always turn out perfect.<sup>17</sup> Even so, I still enjoy the process of cooking and experimenting with ingredients.<sup>18</sup> I hope that one day, I can afford to pursue my passion for photography and cooking.<sup>19</sup> Until then, I'll keep improving my skills in any way I can.<sup>20</sup>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>
                    Cooking is my love language.<sup>1</sup> It's how I express myself, how I connect with my heritage, and how I show care for the people I love.<sup>2</sup> From the comforting aroma of garlic sizzling in oil to the vibrant colors of freshly chopped vegetables, the kitchen is where I feel most at home.<sup>3</sup> I love experimenting with flavors, trying new recipes, and putting my own spin on classic Filipino dishes like adobo and sinigang.<sup>4</sup> There's something incredibly satisfying about transforming simple ingredients into a delicious meal that brings joy to others.<sup>5</sup> It's not just about following a recipe, it's about intuition, creativity, and a touch of magic.<sup>6</sup> And then there's photography.<sup>7</sup> My camera is an extension of my eye, a tool that allows me to capture the beauty I see in the world.<sup>8</sup> It's not just about taking pictures; it's about telling stories.<sup>9</sup> Whether it's the bustling energy of a local market, the quiet serenity of a park, or the fleeting expressions on people's faces, I try to capture the essence of the moment.<sup>10</sup> I love the way light plays on different textures, the way colors blend and contrast, the way a single image can evoke a thousand emotions.<sup>11</sup> Cooking and photography are two sides of the same coin.<sup>12</sup> They both require creativity, attention to detail, and a passion for capturing the beauty in the everyday.<sup>13</sup> They both allow me to express myself and connect with the world around me.<sup>14</sup> Sometimes, I combine my two passions, photographing the dishes I create.<sup>15</sup> It's a way to document my culinary journey and share my creations with others.<sup>16</sup> I envision creating a cookbook one day, a collection of my favorite recipes paired with my photographs, a testament to my love for both art forms.<sup>17</sup> It would be more than just a cookbook, it would be a story told through food and images, a reflection of my soul.<sup>18</sup> Until then, I'll continue to cook, to photograph, and to explore the endless possibilities of these two passions.<sup>19</sup> They bring me joy, they challenge me, and they allow me to share a piece of myself with the world.<sup>20</sup> And that, to me, is the greatest gift of all.<sup>21</sup>
